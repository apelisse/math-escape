# Daily TV Code Challenge - Fraction Parts (Easier)

## Concept of the Day
Build the numerator and denominator first (with addition and multiplication), then divide.

## Instructions
Solve each expression for A, B, C, and D. Each answer is a single digit (0-9). The TV code is ABCD.

## Expressions
- A = $\frac{(2 + 2) * 2}{(3 + 1) * 2} + 1$
- B = $7 - \frac{(1 + 3) * 2}{(2 + 2) * 2}$
- C = $\frac{(1 + 3) * 2}{(1 + 1) * 2} + 1$
- D = $\frac{(2 + 1) * 2}{(1 + 2) * 2} + 3$
