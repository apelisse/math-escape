# Daily TV Code Challenge - Fraction Parts (Easier)

## Concept of the Day
Build the numerator and denominator first (with addition and multiplication), then divide.

## Instructions
Solve each expression for A, B, C, and D. Each answer is a single digit (0-9). The TV code is ABCD.

## Expressions
- A = $1 + \frac{2 * (3 + 1)}{(2 + 2) * 2}$
- B = $7 - \frac{(1 + 3) * 2}{2 * (2 + 2)}$
- C = $\frac{(2 * 3) + 2}{(3 + 1) * 2} + 2$
- D = $4 + \frac{(3 + 1) * 2}{(2 * 2) + 4}$
