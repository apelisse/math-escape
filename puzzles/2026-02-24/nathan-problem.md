# Nathan's Daily TV Code Challenge

## Concept of the Day
Look for matching factors before you multiply. If the same factor is on the top and bottom of a fraction, you can divide both by it first. When you divide by a fraction, flip the second fraction and multiply.

## Instructions
Solve each expression for A, B, C, and D. Use PEMDAS: simplify fractions before multiplying or dividing when that makes the work easier. Each answer is a single digit (0-9). The TV code is ABCD.

## Expressions
- A = $\frac{2 * 3 * 3 * 5 * 8}{9 * 5 * 2}$
- B = $\frac{3 * 7}{2 * 7} * 6 * \frac{2}{3}$
- C = $\frac{6 * 5}{8 * 5} \div \frac{1}{4}$
- D = $\frac{2 * 3 * 5}{3 * 5} \div \frac{7}{2 * 7}$
