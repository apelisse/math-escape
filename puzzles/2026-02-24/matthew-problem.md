# Matthew's Daily TV Code Challenge

## Concept of the Day
Cancel common factors before you do big multiplication. If the same factor appears on the top and bottom of a fraction, you can divide both by it first. When you divide by a fraction, flip the second fraction and multiply.

## Instructions
Solve each expression for A, B, C, and D. Use PEMDAS: simplify fractions before multiplying or dividing when that makes the work easier. Each answer is a single digit (0-9). The TV code is ABCD.

## Expressions
- A = $\frac{2 * 3 * 3 * 5 * 8 * 7 * 11}{9 * 5 * 2 * 7 * 11}$
- B = $\frac{3 * 7 * 5}{2 * 7 * 5} * 6 * \frac{2 * 13}{3 * 13}$
- C = $\frac{6 * 5 * 7}{8 * 5 * 7} \div \frac{3 * 11}{4 * 3 * 11}$
- D = $\frac{2 * 3 * 5 * 11}{3 * 5 * 11} \div \frac{7 * 13}{2 * 7 * 13}$
