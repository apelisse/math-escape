# Matthew's Daily TV Code Challenge

## Concept of the Day
Exponents show repeated multiplication. When you multiply powers with the same base, add the exponents: $2^a \times 2^b = 2^{a + b}$. When you divide powers with the same base, subtract the exponents: $\frac{2^a}{2^b} = 2^{a - b}$.

## Instructions
Solve each expression for A, B, C, and D. Remember PEMDAS: exponents before multiplication or division. Each answer is a single digit (0-9). The TV code is ABCD.

## Expressions
- A = $2^3 \div 2^2$
- B = $(2 + 1)^1 \times 3^1$
- C = $(3^2 \times 3^1) \div 3^2$
- D = $(3^{50} \times 3^{25}) \div 3^{73}$
