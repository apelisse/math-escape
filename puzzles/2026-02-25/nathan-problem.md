# Nathan's Daily TV Code Challenge

## Concept of the Day
When you multiply fractions, look for matching factors you can cancel first. A mixed number like $2 \frac{2}{3}$ can be rewritten as an improper fraction: $\frac{8}{3}$.

## Instructions
Solve each expression for A, B, C, and D. Use PEMDAS, and simplify before you multiply when that makes the work easier. Each answer is a single digit (0-9). The TV code is ABCD.

## Expressions
- A = $\frac{3 * 8}{6}$
- B = $\frac{3}{2} \times \frac{4}{3}$
- C = $\frac{3 * 4}{6} \times 2$
- D = $\frac{3 * 4}{2 * 8} \times 2 \frac{2}{3}$
