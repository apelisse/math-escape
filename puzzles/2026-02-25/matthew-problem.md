# Matthew's Daily TV Code Challenge

## Concept of the Day
Cancel common factors before you do big multiplication. If the same factor appears on the top and bottom of a fraction, you can divide both by it first. When you divide by a fraction, flip the second fraction and multiply.

## Instructions
Solve each expression for A, B, C, and D. Use PEMDAS: simplify fractions before multiplying or dividing when that makes the work easier. Each answer is a single digit (0-9). The TV code is ABCD.

## Expressions
- A = $\frac{2 * 3 * 5 * 7 * 9}{3 * 5 * 7 * 2}$
- B = $\frac{4 * 5 * 3}{2 * 5 * 3} * 3 * \frac{2 * 7}{4 * 7}$
- C = $\frac{8 * 3 * 5}{6 * 5 * 3} \div \frac{2 * 11}{3 * 2 * 11}$
- D = $\frac{2 * 3 * 7 * 13}{3 * 7 * 13} \div \frac{5 * 17}{4 * 5 * 17}$
