# Daily TV Code Challenge - Strategic Parentheses

## Concept of the Day
Order of operations (PEMDAS): parentheses first, then multiply/divide left to right, then add/subtract left to right.

## Instructions
Solve each expression for A, B, C, and D. Each answer is a single digit (0-9). The TV code is ABCD.

## Expressions
- A = $3/4 * (10 - 6) + 1 - 2$
- B = $8 - 5/6 * (12 - 6)$
- C = $9/3 * 2 - (3 + 1)$
- D = $12 - 7/2 * (4 - 2)$
